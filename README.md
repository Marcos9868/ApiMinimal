# Api Minimal

## Objective:

This project aims to put into practice the content learned about Mininal APIs, good practices of organization and componentization of files and services within it. 

This minimal API is used to register, list, modify, and remove products with their respective categories. In addition, it contains a simple authentication system (which at the moment is not saved in a database, a user registration route will be implemented). 

It will also serve for future updates and studies on Design Patterns and Unit Tests.

## Install:

1 - Clone the code

2 - Run these commands
```bash
$ dotnet ef database update
$ dotnet clean
$ dotnet run
```

3 - Verify if API runs correctly


## API Resources:

- Products (CRUD)

- Search by criterion (Name) 
- Authentication for the use of resources
